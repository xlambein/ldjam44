# Biomass

My entry for the 44th Ludum Dare game jam, with theme "Your life is currency".

## Introduction

A game where you try to grow the biomass of your planet.

There are asteroids passing by. Each type of asteroid carries a kind of resource necessary for life. However, life is fragile! In order for it to develop, you need to provide your planet with exactly the right resources, by diverting asteroids away or towards the planet. You can change the course of an asteroid by clicking and dragging on it.

Complete the current “recipe” to produce more biomass. When you reach enough biomass, your life forms will grow to the next stage, requiring different resources.

The game crashes when you reach 0 biomass. That’s because I didn’t have time to make an end screen! :-D

This game is best played on a touch screen, in landscape mode. Try it on your convertible laptop, your smartphone or your tablet.

## How to Play
